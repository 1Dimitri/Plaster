# Plaster

Plaster is a template-based artifact generator written in PowerShell.  Its purpose is to
streamline the creation of PowerShell module projects, Pester tests, DSC configurations,
and more. Artifact generation is performed using crafted templates which allow the user to
fill in details and choose from options to get their desired output.

**NOTE:** This project is at a very early phase of development.
